## Authentication System

The project includes a complete authentication system with a flexible architecture:

### Auth API Architecture

- **`auth.types.ts`**: TypeScript interfaces for authentication (SignUpRequest, SignInRequest, User, AuthResponse)
- **`auth.api.ts`**: Real API implementation for production use
- **`auth.mock.ts`**: Mock API implementation for development and testing
  - Includes a default test user: `ukukovec@example.com` / `password123`
  - Simulates network delays (200ms)
  - Validates passwords and user data
- **`auth.service.ts`**: Service layer that switches between mock and real API
  - Set `USE_MOCK = true` to use mock API (default)
  - Set `USE_MOCK = false` to use real API

### Features

- ✅ User registration (sign up)
- ✅ User login (sign in)
- ✅ Password validation
- ✅ Forgot password functionality
- ✅ Token-based authentication
- ✅ Smooth transitions and loading states

### Default Test Credentials

- **Email**: `ukukovec@example.com`
- **Password**: `password123`
